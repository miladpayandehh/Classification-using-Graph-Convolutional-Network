# Classification-using-Graph-Convolutional-Network (GCN)
A Graph Convolutional Network, or **GCN**, is an approach for semi-supervised learning on graph-structured data. It is based on an efficient variant of convolutional neural networks which operate directly on graphs.

To run this program, we use the **Google Colab** environment. You can also use Jupyter Notebook.
